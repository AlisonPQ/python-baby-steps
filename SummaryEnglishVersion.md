## 1. Introduction

### Programming

#### What is it?

Programming is like **WRITING** a recipe or a list of steps that a computer (or robot) must follow to do something fun — like dancing, singing, drawing, playing, or solving a problem.

- It's about giving instructions to a computer so it performs a specific task (step by step).
- It helps you think like a detective — not just in technology, but in life too.

### Importance of Programming and Applications

Programming is very important because it allows us to create technology, solve problems, and bring ideas to life. It’s like having a digital magic wand that lets you build anything — from games to robots.

| 🌟 Application         | 🔍 What can you do with it?                                                     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎮 Video games         | Create your own games, characters, sounds, and levels.                          |
| 📱 Mobile apps         | Make apps like a social network, a planner, or an educational game.             |
| 🤖 Robotics            | Build robots that dance, follow lines, or help people.                          |
| 🛰️ Science and space   | Program satellites, telescopes, or rockets to explore the universe.             |
| 🏥 Medicine            | Create programs that help doctors detect diseases.                              |
| 🛍️ Online shopping     | Stores like Amazon run thanks to programming.                                   |
| 🚗 Self-driving cars   | Cars that drive themselves use programming to see, decide, and navigate.        |

### 💡 More Uses of Programming

- **Automation**  
- **Data analysis**  
- **Creativity**  
- **Tech industry** (social networks, operating systems, etc.)

> So... programming is the language we use to talk to computers and tell them what to do.  
> And nowadays, knowing how to program is almost as important as knowing how to read or write — why?  
> Because computers are everywhere!

### Algorithms

An algorithm is **LIKE** a step-by-step guide that tells you how to do something. It is a set of clear and ordered instructions that follow a process to solve a problem or complete a task.

When you give directions to your friend to get to your house:

1. Leave the yellow cable car station.
2. Walk 3 blocks east.
3. Cross the street and turn right.
4. Walk 2 more blocks and you will reach a park.
5. My house is right in front of the park, next to the ice cream shop.

> So your friend doesn't get lost.

Note: _This is pseudocode. :D_

``` Python
# More examples?...(Mic to the audience!)
```

### Programming Language

Just like in real life we have languages to speak with each other (Spanish, English, ...), in programming we also use special languages to communicate with computers. But unlike the languages we use every day, programming languages must be very precise and exact, because computers only understand clear instructions.

> Computers are cold.

```python
print("Hello world!")
```

| Language       | What is it used for?                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python**     | Easy to learn and use. Great for beginners and useful for many things, like games and artificial intelligence.                 |
| **JavaScript** | Used to **create interactive websites**. Ideal for making dynamic web pages.                                                   |
| **Java**       | Used to **build large applications**, such as Android mobile apps or enterprise software.                                      |
| **C++**        | Fast and powerful. Ideal for **games** or applications that need a lot of **speed**.                                           |

So...

To write a program, you use:

- A programming language.
- A text editor or development environment (..., REPLIT).

Then, you give the program a set of instructions, and the computer follows them.

### Thinking Like a Programmer

- Divide and conquer.
- Logical and systematic thinking
  - Decomposition
  - Patterns
  - Abstraction

> Don't panic :P

#### Divide and Conquer / Decomposition

This is something programmers do all the time.

When your grandma says: "Hey sweetie, since you're a programmer, make me a party program!"  
`// 100% true story no fake`

You apply the `DIVIDE AND CONQUER` method... You need to organize the party. Instead of trying to do everything at once, you break it down into tasks:

- ~~Make a guest list.~~
- Buy food.
- Decorate the house.
- Prepare the music.

> Same thing applies to programming: when you have a complex problem, you break it down into simpler tasks and solve them step by step—no panic needed.

#### Look for Patterns

Imagine you're playing a card game, and every time you play, you follow the same rules. Why? Because those rules help you play fairly and efficiently.

- Lay out all the cards on the table.
- Compare each card with the next one.
- If they’re in the correct order, leave them.
- If not, swap them.
- Repeat until all cards are in order.

It’s the same in programming: some problems appear over and over again (like sorting cards or organizing items in a list), so programmers use patterns to make the job easier.

#### Abstraction

Abstraction is the art of hiding complicated details so we can focus on what’s important and make things easier. It’s like having a machine that does all the hard work, and you just press one button to control it.

Imagine you have an ice cream machine, and all you have to do is press a button. You don’t need to know how the machine works inside, like which parts mix the ingredients or how it freezes them. You just press the button and ta-da! Ice cream!

Another quick example: a TV remote.

- You don’t need to know how the TV works inside, like what circuits or components make the image appear.
- You just press the remote buttons like “volume up,” “change channel,” or “power off.”

### Introduction to Python

In 1989, a programmer named Guido van Rossum wanted to create a programming language that was easy to understand and fun to use. He thought: “Why do programming languages have to be so complicated and hard? I'm going to make one that's simple and clear!”

**Why is it called Python?**

It has nothing to do with snakes (even though the logo is a snake 🐍). Guido van Rossum was a fan of a TV show called *Monty Python’s Flying Circus*. So he decided to name his new language "Python" for that fun reason!

> Python is a very popular, high-level girl! 😎

#### IDE

**English:** Integrated Development Environment  
**Spanish:** Entorno de Desarrollo Integrado

An IDE is a program that brings together all the tools you need to write, test, and debug programs easily and efficiently. It’s like a super tool to help you code faster and in a more organized way.

**What does an IDE include?**

An IDE has everything you need to code comfortably. Imagine it like a workshop with all the tools at your fingertips:

- **Code Editor:** Like a notebook where you write your program's instructions (the code).
- **Compiler/Interpreter:** Helps translate your code into something the computer can understand and run.
- **Debugger:** Helps you find and fix errors in your code (like a detective solving problems).
- **Terminal or Console:** Lets you see the output of your program or run commands directly.

#### [Replit](https://replit.com/)

Official IDE!! `Only if you want to! ;)`

```python
# Expectation: Click, click... next, next!
# Reality: Well, it depends on the system you're using right now.
# Choose the 'free version'
```

Challenge: Run a "Hello World"

## 2. Data Structures

A data structure is a way to organize and store information so it's easy to use, search, modify, or delete.

### Before we begin, MAGIC RULE

`Each line of code must be properly aligned… or the code turns into spaghetti.`

#### What is indentation?

In Python, indenting means adding spaces at the beginning of lines so the code makes sense. It’s like arranging furniture in your room: if everything’s messy, you can’t move around well.

When you use `if`, `for`, `while`, or define a function...  
The lines that follow must be indented as part of the block.  
`Use the TAB key!`

If you do this, Python will scream! hahaha, like `IndentationError!`

```python
if age < 10:
print("Hello!")  # 😱 Error, it’s all crooked
````

**Important note:**
>_Indenting is organizing… and that’s how my code can shine._

### Lists
- Mutable (you can change the elements).
- Defined with square brackets [].
- You can add, remove, or modify elements.
- Slower than tuples when accessing data.
- Great when you need to change the values later.

```python
backpack = ["notebook", "pencil", "snack", "phone"]

# How to access data
print(backpack[0])  # Output: notebook
print(backpack[3])  # Output: phone

# How to add more items to your list using "append"
backpack.append("sunglasses")
print(backpack)  # Output: ['notebook', 'pencil', 'snack', 'phone', 'sunglasses']

# How to remove items from your list using "remove"
backpack.remove("snack")
print(backpack)  # Output: ['notebook', 'pencil', 'phone', 'sunglasses']

# How to loop through your list
for item in backpack:
  print("I packed my", item)
```

### Tuples

- Immutable (can’t be changed once created).
- Defined with parentheses ().
- You can’t modify their values (unless you use tricks).
- Faster and lighter than lists.
- Ideal for constant data.

```python
# Examples
birthday = (11, "July", 2005)
print(birthday[0]) # Prints just the day

location = (16.5, -68.1)
print(location) # Prints all the data
```

### Lists vs Tuples

Something to think about:

| Data                      | List or Tuple? |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Favorite songs            | List 🎵        |
| Birthdate                 | Tuple 🎂       |
| Shopping list             | List 🛒        |
| Shoe size and height      | Tuple 👟📏     |
| Travel clothes            | List 👚🧳      |
