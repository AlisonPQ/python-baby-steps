## 1. Introduction

### Programming

#### What is it?

Programming is like **WRITING** a recipe or a list of steps that a computer (or robot) must follow to do something fun — like dancing, singing, drawing, playing, or solving a problem.

- It's about giving instructions to a computer so it performs a specific task (step by step).
- It helps you think like a detective — not just in technology, but in life too.

### Importance of Programming and Applications

Programming is very important because it allows us to create technology, solve problems, and bring ideas to life. It’s like having a digital magic wand that lets you build anything — from games to robots.

| 🌟 Application         | 🔍 What can you do with it?                                                     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎮 Video games         | Create your own games, characters, sounds, and levels.                          |
| 📱 Mobile apps         | Make apps like a social network, a planner, or an educational game.             |
| 🤖 Robotics            | Build robots that dance, follow lines, or help people.                          |
| 🛰️ Science and space   | Program satellites, telescopes, or rockets to explore the universe.             |
| 🏥 Medicine            | Create programs that help doctors detect diseases.                              |
| 🛍️ Online shopping     | Stores like Amazon run thanks to programming.                                   |
| 🚗 Self-driving cars   | Cars that drive themselves use programming to see, decide, and navigate.        |

### 💡 More Uses of Programming

- **Automation**  
- **Data analysis**  
- **Creativity**  
- **Tech industry** (social networks, operating systems, etc.)

> So... programming is the language we use to talk to computers and tell them what to do.  
> And nowadays, knowing how to program is almost as important as knowing how to read or write — why?  
> Because computers are everywhere!

### Algorithms

An algorithm is **LIKE** a step-by-step guide that tells you how to do something. It is a set of clear and ordered instructions that follow a process to solve a problem or complete a task.

When you give directions to your friend to get to your house:

1. Leave the yellow cable car station.
2. Walk 3 blocks east.
3. Cross the street and turn right.
4. Walk 2 more blocks and you will reach a park.
5. My house is right in front of the park, next to the ice cream shop.

> So your friend doesn't get lost.
