## 1. Introduction

### Programming

#### What is it?

Programming is like **WRITING** a recipe or a list of steps that a computer (or robot) must follow to do something fun — like dancing, singing, drawing, playing, or solving a problem.

- It's about giving instructions to a computer so it performs a specific task (step by step).
- It helps you think like a detective — not just in technology, but in life too.

### Importance of Programming and Applications

Programming is very important because it allows us to create technology, solve problems, and bring ideas to life. It’s like having a digital magic wand that lets you build anything — from games to robots.
